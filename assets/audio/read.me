Good early morning, Golen & crew! I've collected some sound effects for you.
The OGG files come from Sounds Crate, while all the WAV files are taken from Mario games - mostly the 2D platformer titles, but there's some SFX from the spin-offs as well. 
I'm planning to make the UI sounds later today. In the meantime, pick the most fitting sound effects and put them in! I wish you the best of luck.
